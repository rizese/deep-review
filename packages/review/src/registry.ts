/**
 * The set of PRs one navigation server holds, and the lifecycle of each.
 *
 * A PR arrives as a URL and nothing else. Slicing it and walking its call
 * graphs is slow — a paid model call, then a language service over a whole
 * checkout — so a PR is added at once and built in the background, a few at
 * a time; the page for it says "building" until it is ready. Once built, its
 * language services are started only when a reader first clicks a symbol,
 * and let go again when the page goes away or the entry sits idle, because
 * a session is fully derivable from what was built and cheap to recreate.
 *
 * What was built is kept on disk too. A server lives for weeks and is
 * restarted for the most ordinary reasons — a new version, a reboot — and
 * without a memory every restart emptied the index and cost a slicing run
 * per PR to refill it. The ready PRs are written to one JSON file under the
 * state dir whenever the set of them changes, and read back when the
 * registry is made, so a restart resumes with the same pages and no builds.
