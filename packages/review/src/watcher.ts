/**
 * The watcher: the thing that notices a PR was assigned to you and hands it
 * to the server, so that a review is waiting rather than asked for.
 *
 * It polls rather than taking webhooks, because the machine it runs on is a
 * laptop that gets closed. A webhook delivered to a sleeping laptop is gone;
 * a poll asks GitHub for the *current* set of PRs assigned to you, so one
 * poll after the lid opens catches up on the whole night with no cursor
 * arithmetic, no public ingress, and nothing to replay. Missing a poll is
 * therefore uninteresting by construction — the next one subsumes it.
 *
 * What it polls is exactly the repos named in `watch.json`, each with its
 * own query; see `watchConfig.ts`. An empty or missing file means it watches
 * nothing, and says so. It never means "everything".
 *
 * State lives beside the server's, under `~/.deep-review` (or
 * $DEEP_REVIEW_HOME): one directory of truth even though the watcher and the
 * server are separate processes.
